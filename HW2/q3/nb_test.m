% matrix as in the original training data matrix).

% Write code below to classify each document in the test set (ie, each row
% in the current document word matrix) as 1 for SPAM and 0 for NON-SPAM.

% of this vector is the predicted class (1/0) for the i-th  email (i-th row

% Compute the error on the test set
